# Coin Flip Simulator Collection ü™ô

A collection of Python programs demonstrating the **Law of Large Numbers** using coin flips.  
These projects explore randomness, streaks, ratios, and visualizations.

## Projects

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ One Random Flip

- Flip a coin once each time you press Enter.
- Type `'q'` to quit.
- See immediate results for each flip.
- **Goal:** Simple, interactive coin flip simulation.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Multi Flip Counter

- Flip the coin multiple times at once.
- Displays total **Heads** and **Tails** counts and percentages.
- **Goal:** Observe how results approach 50/50 as the number of flips increases.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Running Ratio Flip

- Flip the coin multiple times with progress updates at intervals.
- Shows how the **Heads/Tails ratio** changes over time.
- **Goal:** Understand convergence to 50% ratio in stages.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Streak Counter

- Flip the coin multiple times while tracking consecutive streaks of Heads or Tails.
- Displays the **longest streak** for each side.
- **Goal:** Explore patterns and streaks in random sequences.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Coin Flip Visualizer (Plots)

- **Stage 1:** Tracks Heads ratio over multiple flips and plots it.
- **Stage 2:** Tracks both Heads and Tails ratios and plots them together.
- Visualizations show how ratios stabilize near 50% as flips increase.
