Perfect! We can create a **README** for this program, which is your **Multi Flip Counter** that demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers. Hereâ€™s a beginner-friendly version you can add to your `project3_CoinFlipSimulator` repo:

# Multi Flip Counter ðŸª™

## Description

The **Multi Flip Counter** simulates flipping a coin multiple times and demonstrates the **Law of Large Numbers (LLN)**.

The LLN states that as the number of independent trials increases, the observed fraction of outcomes approaches the expected probability.

For a fair coin:

* Probability of **Heads** = 50%
* Probability of **Tails** = 50%

This program allows the user to specify the number of flips and see how the results converge toward 50/50 as the number of flips increases.

---

## Features

* Flip the coin **any number of times**.
* Counts the **number of heads and tails**.
* Displays **percentages** of heads and tails.
* Includes a detailed explanation of the **Law of Large Numbers** and how results converge statistically.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the program:

```bash
python multiFlipCounter.py
```

5. Enter the number of coin flips and observe the results.

## Example Usage

```
Please enter how many times you want to flip this coin ðŸª™  : 1000

After 1000 flips, the results were: 
Heads: 503 (50.30%)
Tails: 497 (49.70%)
```

## Learning Outcomes

* Understand the **Law of Large Numbers** through experimentation.
* Practice using Python **loops**, **conditionals**, and the **random module**.
* Calculate and display **percentages** and **statistics** dynamically.
